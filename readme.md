# Data Science Learning Schedule

Hi I am Reshma Tadas. I am currently working as Data Science Engineer at Aindra Labs. I have complete Data Science course at GreyAtom. Even though I know theoritical concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning well, I still have a lot to learn especially the math behind data science. This is an attempt to scedule and documentation of my learning process, which may help anyone who is looking for in depth understanding of Data Science. 

### Scedule

The learning starts on 23rd May 2020 and ends on Mar 21, 2021 (Along with 6 projects).

### Courses Covered

1. Calculus (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/video-lectures/).
2. Liner Algebra (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/).
3. Probability Theory (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/).
4. A first course on optimization (CDEEP).
5. Convex Optimization (CDEEP).
6. Deep Learning 1 (https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106184/).
7. Deep Learning 2 (https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106201/).
8. Deep Learning Certification(Just to test my knowledge): https://swayam.gov.in/nd1_noc20_cs62/preview.
9. Deep learning ofr computer vision certification (https://swayam.gov.in/nd1_noc20_cs88/preview).
10. Predictive Analytics certification (To understand business point of view and get some analyitical skills): https://swayam.gov.in/nd2_imb20_mg41/preview.

### Projects

1. Project on Computer Vision.
2. Project on Recommendation Engine.
3. Project on Reinforcement Learning.
4. Project on Computer vision and IoT.
5. Project on speech Recognition.
6. Project on Signal Processing.

### Prerequisites

Machine Learning is not covered here as I have fair idea of ML concepts. If you want to learn ML, follow Andrew N G's course on coursera. Since I am sarting Deep lerning course from day 1, along with the course in Calculus, if you have good undersanding of basics of Maths, it will be easier to follow DL course. Otherwise you can park DL course till you complete Calculus, linear Algebra, probability and ML courses and then start with the DL course. 

### What will the repository contain?

It will have my notes, resources and scedule. I have tendency to document everything, so my notes will give you each and every information shared in the MOOCs.
